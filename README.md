Linear Search
I chose linear search since I thought it would be simplest to implement and easiest for someone new to understand

Problem Decomposition:
Loop through the list, for each element, compare them to the target. If it matches, then return the index it was found and break out of the loop, if not, then continue looping. If the target isn’t found in the list, then say it isn’t found. 

Pattern Recognition:
Uses a simple for loop to compare each element of the list with the target. 

Abstraction: 
Only need to show the current value and the target value being compared. 

Algorithm Design: 
The user will create their own list and target value and if the list and target value are valid then loop through and show each step
